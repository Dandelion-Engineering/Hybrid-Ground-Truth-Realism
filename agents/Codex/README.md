## What each file owns

- **`Summary of Only Necessary Context.md`** — authoritative next-session continuity, rewritten at every closeout.
- **`Literature Foundation.md`** — Codex's dated and frozen Phase 0 field survey.
- **`Tier A Real-Arm Donor Matching Rule.md`** — same-state-approved pre-pool specification for the deterministic real-control donor matcher. Claude and Codex explicitly approve Draft 6 SHA-256 `51adae4bd19ffc2ef72445e474371b56eee04d93883c6da1d59fedbca553f282`. It uses one fixed target manifest, `N = 10…16`, full-sixteen Z removal, two-level provenance-count equality at every stage, and a separate exact exposure-schedule/placement-specification gate before any host-specific manifest or pool. This is not an implementation, pool, configuration, balance verdict, or execution authorization.
- **`references.md`** — Codex's living source ledger and transferable citations.
- **`tools/probe_draft16_safety_claims.py`** — deterministic synthetic review probe showing that label-blind unit expansion and retaining a first bin do not have the one-way safety guarantees claimed in Claude Draft 16. It reads no candidate asset.
- **`Session Summaries/HumanReport<N>.md`** — permanent detailed session reports for the director.
- **`Progress Reports/`** — director-facing reports triggered by phase changes, approved amendments, and the eight-session cadence. The newest is the Session 16 count-based report. The next count-based report is Session 24.

## Shared work outside this folder

- `chats/Claude-Codex/Phase 0 Literature Comparison/`, `Claim Sheet Review/`, `Study Guide Pass 1 Review/`, `Compute Environment Update/`, `Reproducibility Packet Review/`, and `Tier A Donor Matching Rule/` are concluded.
- `chats/Claude-Codex/Tier A Selection Review/` is active. Section 15's thirteen-host order remains same-state approved. Codex blocked Claude Draft 16's two one-way safety claims with deterministic counterexamples and directly repaired the artifact to Draft 17 SHA-256 `709be46fd0f1d23c7677787410419cf63a7ff5a03945bc88bff2c9db625909eb`. Draft 17 retains the pre-measurement label-blind unit set and rank-1 head-bin treatment, makes both conditional rather than guaranteed-pessimistic, reports quality-label composition, and treats containment margins as endpoint slack. Claude owner re-review is open on those exact bytes. The numeric utility's numerical logic is unchanged, but its public input now says session-time `extent_s`; Codex approves SHA-256 `b2c016053b18ffb49b0e9e3c439af22a7ea1d6b1b306857fe9d9b9f0eea9ac66`, and Claude owner re-review is also open there. No archive CLI or candidate value exists.
- `Claim Sheet.md` and `Accessible Claim Sheet.md` are synchronized at SHA-256 `2feda611d78684bfe522258fb2f67fecbd6fe2b6ccadb6362056c79e9aeae365` / `679918f7afc41b641530b8d26b1700da226c3f3fc62c06fee3918841c3c9b1dd`. Amendments 1–6 are `In force`. The matching-rule prose, implementation/tests, host-dependent exact configuration, and manipulation gate remain separate approvals.
- `Study Guide/Pass 1 - Conceptual Foundation.tex` and PDF are approved Phase 1 artifacts. Pass 2 remains a Phase 3 deliverable.
- `director_requests.md` contains one open non-blocking Phase 1 contract-review item. No new director action is needed.
- Root `README.md` is the append-only public live-run page. Codex Session 21 appended a forward correction showing that label-blind expansion and a head-undercovered bin have no guaranteed pessimistic direction, while keeping the choices predeclared and separate from any candidate result.
- The Reproducibility Packet is co-owned. Its design-stage runbook remains same-state approved at ten steps. Codex owns Rung 0, the sorter-panel decision, inference/negative-control harness, Tier A's independent balance/manipulation gate, and the two-part placement calibration.

## Current technical boundaries

- Rung 0 must build and pin the host injection substrate before injection because donor templates already carry `phase_shift` and SpikeInterface 0.104.8 does not preprocess inside `generate_hybrid_recording()`.
- Pre-rescaling scale factor is an integrity diagnostic, not a matching covariate.
- Same-state-approved matcher Draft 6 uses common U-derived scaling for amplitude/effective-SNR/depth, donor-equal global no-reuse assignment, and no region term. It computes T and `N` once from a pinned target manifest, preserves the full sixteen-key Z removal, makes joint block-placement failure reject the host, and tests exact insertion/session/subject-count equality before falling back at the same provenance stage to the contract's literal insertion-count floor.
- Before T is measured or any host-specific manifest/pool is opened, an exact exposure-schedule/placement specification and synthetic tests must pin the nuisance seed, amplitude target, and commanded-placement construction. Matcher implementation/test review follows as another same-state gate.
- The derived CCF label layer is opt-in; recognized white-matter/fibre-tract labels remain non-injectable. Any non-CA1 zone change must define the removal set across parent/descendant labels before matching.
- The drift implementation's numerical logic remains validated, but the exact-state loop is reopened by the `duration_s`→`extent_s` interface/documentation repair. Claude must owner-approve utility `b2c01605…` and Draft 17 `709be46f…` before the archive CLI is written. The future reader must confirm ragged time/depth alignment, finite per-spike depths, exact-asset session-time provenance and containment, and valid same-probe `max_electrode -> rel_y` mappings; it must also preserve full unit identifiers and quality labels for the in-band and included sets. The module fails loudly on malformed unit collections and duplicate row IDs; 57 synthetic checks pass at all 200 permutations.
- `.gitattributes` makes repository-wide checkout bytes explicit and is same-state approved by both agents. All paths default to `-text`; 17 framework files and 11 legacy packet outputs intentionally reconstruct CRLF. A temporary `core.autocrlf=true` clone matched all 153 reviewed tracked files byte-for-byte.
- No host is pinned, no candidate drift value has been read, and no dependency install, raw-data read, Rung 0, generation, or sorter run has occurred.

For resumption, read `Summary of Only Necessary Context.md`, then the latest human report. Use `references.md` rather than memory for citations.
