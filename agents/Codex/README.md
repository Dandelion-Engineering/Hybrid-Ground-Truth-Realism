## What each file owns

- **`Summary of Only Necessary Context.md`** — authoritative next-session continuity, rewritten at every closeout.
- **`Literature Foundation.md`** — Codex's dated and frozen Phase 0 field survey.
- **`Tier A Real-Arm Donor Matching Rule.md`** — same-state-approved pre-pool specification for the deterministic real-control donor matcher. Claude and Codex explicitly approve Draft 6 SHA-256 `51adae4bd19ffc2ef72445e474371b56eee04d93883c6da1d59fedbca553f282`. It uses one fixed target manifest, `N = 10…16`, full-sixteen Z removal, two-level provenance-count equality at every stage, and a separate exact exposure-schedule/placement-specification gate before any host-specific manifest or pool. This is not an implementation, pool, configuration, balance verdict, or execution authorization.
- **`references.md`** — Codex's living source ledger and transferable citations.
- **`Session Summaries/HumanReport<N>.md`** — permanent detailed session reports for the director.
- **`Progress Reports/`** — director-facing reports triggered by phase changes, approved amendments, and the eight-session cadence. The newest is the Session 16 count-based report. The next count-based report is Session 24.

## Shared work outside this folder

- `chats/Claude-Codex/Phase 0 Literature Comparison/`, `Claim Sheet Review/`, `Study Guide Pass 1 Review/`, `Compute Environment Update/`, `Reproducibility Packet Review/`, and `Tier A Donor Matching Rule/` are concluded.
- `chats/Claude-Codex/Tier A Selection Review/` is active. The drift module `d8b03596…` and synthetic harness `82aaf77e…` are same-state approved by both agents. Codex approves and handed back Draft 13 SHA-256 `82d58b4009774adc63817da78be247c137cd5fa105e5553a8fe1c4e775349cc8`, the supporting review probe `4f3b8377…`, and repository-wide `.gitattributes` `036c696c…`; Claude owner re-review is open on those exact states. Section 15's thirteen-host order remains same-state approved. Section 16 now pins its processed-timebase anchor/extent precondition, treats an unreconciled clock as an input error rather than a host rejection, and confines the null-scaling guarantee to observed `Delta_10`. This is not a pinned-host approval and no candidate drift value has been read.
- `Claim Sheet.md` and `Accessible Claim Sheet.md` are synchronized at SHA-256 `2feda611d78684bfe522258fb2f67fecbd6fe2b6ccadb6362056c79e9aeae365` / `679918f7afc41b641530b8d26b1700da226c3f3fc62c06fee3918841c3c9b1dd`. Amendments 1–6 are `In force`. The matching-rule prose, implementation/tests, host-dependent exact configuration, and manipulation gate remain separate approvals.
- `Study Guide/Pass 1 - Conceptual Foundation.tex` and PDF are approved Phase 1 artifacts. Pass 2 remains a Phase 3 deliverable.
- `director_requests.md` contains one open non-blocking Phase 1 contract-review item. No new director action is needed.
- Root `README.md` is the append-only public live-run page. Session 19 appended a forward correction narrowing the drift guarantee to the observed statistic and recorded the independently reproduced repository-wide clone state; it keeps reviewer approval separate from owner re-review and execution.
- The Reproducibility Packet is co-owned. Its design-stage runbook remains same-state approved at ten steps. Codex owns Rung 0, the sorter-panel decision, inference/negative-control harness, Tier A's independent balance/manipulation gate, and the two-part placement calibration.

## Current technical boundaries

- Rung 0 must build and pin the host injection substrate before injection because donor templates already carry `phase_shift` and SpikeInterface 0.104.8 does not preprocess inside `generate_hybrid_recording()`.
- Pre-rescaling scale factor is an integrity diagnostic, not a matching covariate.
- Same-state-approved matcher Draft 6 uses common U-derived scaling for amplitude/effective-SNR/depth, donor-equal global no-reuse assignment, and no region term. It computes T and `N` once from a pinned target manifest, preserves the full sixteen-key Z removal, makes joint block-placement failure reject the host, and tests exact insertion/session/subject-count equality before falling back at the same provenance stage to the contract's literal insertion-count floor.
- Before T is measured or any host-specific manifest/pool is opened, an exact exposure-schedule/placement specification and synthetic tests must pin the nuisance seed, amplitude target, and commanded-placement construction. Matcher implementation/test review follows as another same-state gate.
- The derived CCF label layer is opt-in; recognized white-matter/fibre-tract labels remain non-injectable. Any non-CA1 zone change must define the removal set across parent/descendant labels before matching.
- The drift implementation loop is closed. Draft 13 Section 16 remains open on Claude owner re-review of Codex's claim/status repairs. The future archive CLI must confirm the ragged indices, finite per-spike depths, and processed/raw timebase reconciliation before computing; an unreconciled clock pauses the pinned order as an input error. The module fails loudly on malformed unit collections and duplicate row IDs; 57 synthetic checks pass at all 200 permutations.
- `.gitattributes` makes repository-wide checkout bytes explicit. All paths default to `-text`; 17 framework files and 11 legacy packet outputs intentionally reconstruct CRLF. A temporary `core.autocrlf=true` clone matched all 153 reviewed tracked files byte-for-byte. Claude exact-state owner review remains open on the comment-corrected policy even though the technical defect is repaired.
- No host is pinned, no candidate drift value has been read, and no dependency install, raw-data read, Rung 0, generation, or sorter run has occurred.

For resumption, read `Summary of Only Necessary Context.md`, then the latest human report. Use `references.md` rather than memory for citations.
